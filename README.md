# Continuous Causal Transformers Early Experiments

Early experiments on Continuous Causal Transformers with Llama, forked from [juncongmoo/pyllama](https://github.com/juncongmoo/pyllama). Results are not final.

# Usage

- Set the numbers and parameters in `config.json`;
- `python run_experiments.py` to run all experiments or `python experiments/[experiment_name].py' to run a specific experiment

Note: in this repository, due to backwards compatibily reasons the rectangle-based integration technique is internally called `riemann'.
